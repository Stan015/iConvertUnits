# iConvertUnits: a units converter app

## What inspired the project?

* To be able to convert units and copy the result with their respective suffix rather than just the number result then manually typing the suffix in my code. e.g '39px', '27rem'... rather than copy '27' then go back to my code to past it and then add the suffix 'rem'.
* To have a nice looking UI. Since it a very important app I use often to convert units while coding, I need it to look very simple and classic.

## What was considered during the building stage?

* Well structured, reusable and readable functions.
* Good regular expression to extract numbers only if user inputs lets say 100px, the number '100' is extracted and used for conversion. The regular expression also handles negative inputs, floating points numbers and of course integers.
* Better UI to keep user happy while interacting with the app.
* Time saving.
* Keyboard accessibility for screen readers

## Who can use this app?

Anyone can use this app. The primary function of the app is to convert units, thus, anybody; Developers and Non-Developers can use this app for their unit conversion.

## Is it open for contributions?

Yes. This project is open for contributions. Feel free to add more units conversion functions, edit or correct any open issue or bug observed while using the app.
